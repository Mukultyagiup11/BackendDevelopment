This repository contains backend practice projects and exercises focused on Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes implementations of RESTful APIs, authentication with JWT, database operations with Mongoose, and middleware for error handling and request validation. The projects are designed to practice and strengthen backend development skills, including security best practices, modular code structure, and API design. This repo serves as a learning ground for experimenting with different backend concepts and building hands-on experience in full-stack development.
