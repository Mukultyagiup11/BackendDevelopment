//CORS built in Function:-
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Node.js is a security mechanism that allows web applications running at one origin (domain, protocol, and port) to make requests for resources from a different origin. Its primary use is to bypass the "same-origin policy" enforced by web browsers, which by default prevents such cross-origin requests for security reasons.
